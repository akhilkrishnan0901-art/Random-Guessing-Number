# Random-Guessing-Number
This is a simple Python console-based game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it.  The program uses Python’s built-in random module to generate a number. The user is prompted to enter their guess, which is then compared with the computer-generated number using conditional statements.

# Project Description

The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using Python’s built-in random module.
The user is prompted to guess the number, and the program compares the user's input with the randomly generated number.

# Based on the comparison, the program provides feedback:

 If the guessed number is lower than the computer’s number → it informs the user accordingly.
 If the guessed number is higher than the computer’s number → it notifies the user.
 If the guessed number matches the computer’s number → it displays a success message.

# Concepts Used

 random.randint() for generating random numbers
 input() function for user interaction
Type casting (int())
 Conditional statements (if, elif, else)

# How It Works

The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100.
The user enters their guess.
The program compares both numbers.
 Feedback is displayed based on the result.

# Purpose

This project is ideal for beginners learning:

Python basics
Logical thinking
control flow
Interactive console applications
