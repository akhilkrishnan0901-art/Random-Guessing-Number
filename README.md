# Random-Guessing-Number
This is a simple Python console-based game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it.  The program uses Python’s built-in random module to generate a number. The user is prompted to enter their guess, which is then compared with the computer-generated number using conditional statements.
