# Random-Guessing-Number
This is a simple Python console-based game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it.  The program uses Python’s built-in random module to generate a number. The user is prompted to enter their guess, which is then compared with the computer-generated number using conditional statements.

📌 Project Description

The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using Python’s built-in random module.
The user is prompted to guess the number, and the program compares the user's input with the randomly generated number.

Based on the comparison, the program provides feedback:

# If the guessed number is lower than the computer’s number → it informs the user accordingly.
# If the guessed number is higher than the computer’s number → it notifies the user.
# If the guessed number matches the computer’s number → it displays a success message.

🛠️ Concepts Used

# random.randint() for generating random numbers
# input() function for user interaction
# Type casting (int())
# Conditional statements (if, elif, else)

🎮 How It Works

# The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100.
# The user enters their guess.
# The program compares both numbers.
# Feedback is displayed based on the result.

🚀 Purpose

This project is ideal for beginners learning:

# Python basics
# Logical thinking
# Control flow
# Interactive console applications
